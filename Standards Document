Free-mo N Scale (Free-moN) Modular Railroading
Raising the Bar for N Scale Modular Railroading

Standards and Recmmendations


## Overview ##

Fre-mo N attempts to raise-the-bar for N scale modular railroading by specifying standars for benchwork, track, and digital control that promotes, and even forces, prototypical appearance and operational characteristics.  This dcument contains standards that must be followed, and recommendations that have been gathered from various sources.  


## Objectives ##

The Free-moN Standard has teh following objectives:
  1. To promote and require hi-fedility prototypical scale model railroading.
  2. To ensure reliable track and electrical operation.
  3. To encourage visual continuity between modules.
  4. To encourge a loose association among individuals; free from club memberships, dues, and titles.
  5. To keep the standard specifiations to a minimum without compormising the previous objectives.


## Definitions ##

Framework:
A modules structural frame, including endplates, legs, bracing, and scenic subroadbed.

Module Section:
  A framework, complete with track, scenery, and electrical components for display and operation of model trains.

Module Group:
  A group of Module Sections that is meant to be operated as a single unit in a fixed configuration.  A module group can have any number of sections.  The ends of a Module Group must follow the Standard Endplate requirements defined below.
  
Standard Endplate:
The end piece of a module or module group's framework that can interface with any other Standard Endplate on a layout.

Inter-module Endplate:
The end piece of a module section that can only interface with a counterpart of the same module group.  
  
  
  ## Endplates ##
  
Endplates shall be 3/4 inch birch plywood or equivalent material that resists warping and be 6 inches high with a minimum width of 12 inches and a maximum width of 24 inches.  Module to module endplates shall be secured with mechanical clamps.
